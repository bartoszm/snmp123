This is version 6.0 of the simple Java SNMPv1, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3 stack.
It can be downloaded from our homepage:
- http://www.westhawk.co.uk/resources/snmp/snmp6_0.zip        (2.0 Mb)
- http://www.westhawk.co.uk/resources/snmp/stubBrowser6_0.zip (53 K)

Intermediate changes can now be downloaded via cvs from SourceForge:
- http://sourceforge.net/projects/westhawksnmp/
Since we moved the sources to SourceForge, we felt that a major version
increment was in order.

Read the file StackUsage.html for general information how to use the stack.
The frequently asked questions can be found in faq.html.
